\section*{Abstract}
		Over the past years, various Cross-site scripting (XSS) mitigation techniques were developed to tackle the problem of code injection vulnerabilities present in web application code bases.  The majority of these mitigations, however, share an assumption that says preventing XSS happens when detecting and blocking execution of illegitimate injected JavaScript code. This assumption slowly becomes a limitation to mitigations as modern JavaScript libraries and code patterns are introduced, which in turn expand the vulnerability vector in a way current XSS prevention techniques canâ€™t recognize.\todo{Need to be fixed and expanded}
